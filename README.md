## Introduction
As part of my studies as a Data Analyst at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I have recently been entrusted with a critical task that involves analyzing consumer complaints received by financial institutions from 2013 to 2015. Having run the analysis with MySQL, this report provides an overview of the database file named "ComplaintsDB.sql" and present key insights derived from the analysis.
The ComplaintsDB.sql database encompasses a comprehensive collection of consumer complaints, enabling us see the challenges faced by consumers during this period.
